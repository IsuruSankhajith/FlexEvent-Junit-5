- **Input Validation:** Ensures the validity of date and time inputs, handles text inputs with case sensitivity, and validates numeric inputs.
- **Error Handling:** Provides clear error messages for invalid inputs and confirmation messages upon successful operations.
- **Unit Testing:** Implements black-box testing using Equivalence Partitioning and Boundary Value Analysis, along with unit testing using JUnit 5 and Control Flow Graphs (CFG).

### Testing:
- **Black-box Testing:** Re-implementation of test cases using Equivalence Partitioning and Boundary Value Analysis to verify software functionality and address previously identified issues.
- **Unit Testing:** CFGs devised for each class, with unit tests conducted on selected classes to achieve statement and branch coverage.

### Tools:
- **JUnit 5:** Utilized for unit testing.
- **System Lambda:** Additional library for storing console output during testing.

### How to Use:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the Java source code.
3. Run the program using the command `java Planner` from the command prompt.
4. Follow the prompts on the CLI to interact with the system functionalities.
